 * Single product short description
 *
 * This template can be overridden by copying it to yourtheme/woocommerce/single-product/short-description.php.
 *
 * HOWEVER, on occasion WooCommerce will need to update template files and you
 * (the theme developer) will need to copy the new files to your theme to
 * maintain compatibility. We try to do this as little as possible, but it does
 * happen. When this occurs the version of the template file will be bumped and
 * the readme will list any important changes.
 *
 * @see     https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/template-structure/
 * @package WooCommerce/Templates

This clause is not intended to exclude or limit any rights which you may have under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth).</li></ul><ol start="2"><li><strong>Price and Payment</strong></li></ol><ul><li>When you place an Order, we will charge you and you agree to pay the Price and any applicable Delivery Fee.</li><li>All Prices are in Australian Dollars and, if GST applies, inclusive of GST.

If you have already submitted an Order at a particular Price, we will supply your Goods at that Price (unless your Order is affected by a pricing error, in which case clause 8 will apply).</li><li>Recommended Retail Price (RRP) is the price given by our suppliers at the time of stocking. We often sell products at less than the RRP.</li><li>We do not guarantee to match our website prices on products for sale on our shop floor. This is due to the cost of receiving, handling, storing and displaying products, as well as allowing you to physically try and test the product before purchase.</li><li>Payment methods are specified on the Website or told to you at the time you place your Order. They include credit card with eWay and payment through your online PayPal account. The name on any credit card used for payment must match the name of the Order. Cheques cannot be used as a payment method for any purchases from&nbsp;Billy Hyde Music, including Orders.</li><li>Please note for any purchases of significant amounts using credit card details via eWay, we will contact you for further identification proof and security checks before we are able to dispatch the Goods. We reserve the right to cancel the Order and issue a refund if we cannot complete the security checks satisfactorily.</li><li>In paying or attempting to pay for Goods, you agree that you have not engaged in any fraudulent conduct or contravened by any Law.</li><li>All online payments are processed using industry-standard SSL 256bit encryption with Geotrust True BusinessID and extended validation.
